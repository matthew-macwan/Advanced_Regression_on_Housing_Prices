# Advanced_Regression_Techniques

In this project, I analyzed housing data to predict the sale price of a home based on other attributes in the Ames Housing dataset. This dataset contains information from homes in Ames, Iowa. The project contained a rigorous exploratory analysis and a decent amount of data cleaning. In the end, I found the excellent variables to predict sales price, explained some of the attribute's significance to the target variable and built various different regressors comparing their performance.
