# Advanced_Regression_on_Housing_Prices

In this project, I analyzed housing data to predict the sale price of a home based on other attributes in the Ames Housing dataset. This dataset contains information from homes in Ames, Iowa. In the end, I found some excellent variables to predict sales price, explained some of the attribute's significance to the target variable and built various different regressors comparing their performance.
